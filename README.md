## Diabetes Prediction
This Streamlit app predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input. It utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier model trained on a diabetes dataset to make predictions.

## Features
- Input fields for user data including pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
- Predicts whether the user has diabetes or not.
- Displays appropriate messages based on the prediction result.

## User Inputs
1. **Pregnancies**: 
    - The number of pregnancies the user has had.
    - This can be an important factor in predicting the risk of diabetes, as pregnancy-related changes in hormone levels can affect insulin sensitivity.
2. **Glucose Level**: 
    - The user's current glucose (blood sugar) level.
    - Elevated glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes, as diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels.
3. **Blood Pressure**: 
    - The user's blood pressure reading.
    - High blood pressure can be associated with diabetes and its complications, making it relevant for predicting diabetes risk.
4. **Skin Thickness**: 
    - The thickness of the user's skin (measured in millimeters).
    - Skin thickness can be related to metabolic factors and may provide insights into diabetes risk.
5. **Insulin Level**: 
    - The user's insulin level (measured in mU/L or microunits per liter).
    - Insulin plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism, and abnormal insulin levels can be indicative of diabetes.
6. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: 
    - The user's BMI, calculated based on their weight and height.
    - BMI is a common indicator of overall health and can be associated with diabetes risk, especially in cases of obesity.
7. **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: 
    - A numerical value representing the diabetes pedigree function.
    - This function estimates diabetes heredity and is based on family history and genetic factors.
8. **Age**: 
    - The user's age.
    - Age is a significant risk factor for diabetes, as the likelihood of developing diabetes increases with age.


## How to Use
1. Install the required libraries.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the Streamlit app.
```bash
stremalit run app.py 
```
If the above command does not works then try the below command
```bash
python -m stremalit run app.py 
```
3. Fill in the required fields with relevant data.
4. Click the "Make Prediction" button to see the prediction result.


## Dependencies
1. 'Streamlit': Streamlit is a Python library used for building interactive web applications. It provides simple APIs for creating user interfaces and visualizations.
```bash
import streamlit as st
```
2. `Pandas`: Pandas is a popular data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It is used for reading and processing data from various sources, such as CSV files.
```bash
import pandas as pd
```
3. `scikit-learn (sklearn)`: scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python that provides various algorithms and tools for machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.
```bash
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```
4. `DecisionTreeClassifier`: DecisionTreeClassifier is a classification algorithm from the scikit-learn library. It is used to train a decision tree model for predicting the outcome (diabetes or non-diabetes) based on input features.
5. `train_test_split`: train_test_split is a function from scikit-learn used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. It helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Files included
- `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, etc.
- `app.py`: Contains the Streamlit app code for the web interface and model prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `diabetes_dataset.csv`: The dataset file used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: Documentation file explaining the project, installation steps, usage instructions, etc.

## Decision Tree Classifier
1. Decision Tree Learning: Decision tree learning is a supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome or class label.
2. DecisionTreeClassifier Algorithm:
    - DecisionTreeClassifier builds a decision tree during training.
    - It splits the data into subsets based on the value of a feature, aiming to minimize impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy).
    - During prediction, it follows the decision path down the tree until reaching a leaf node, which determines the class label (0 for non-diabetes, 1 for diabetes).

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. Dataset: The model is trained on a diabetes dataset containing features such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The target variable is the diabetes outcome (0 for non-diabetes, 1 for diabetes).
2. Training Process:
    - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
    - The DecisionTreeClassifier model is initialized with default hyperparameters.
    - The model is trained using the training data (X_train, y_train) to learn patterns and relationships between input features and the target variable.
3. Model Evaluation:
    - The model's performance is evaluated on a separate testing set (X_test, y_test) to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
    - During prediction, user inputs (e.g., pregnancies, glucose level, etc.) are collected and fed into the trained model. The model predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on the learned patterns.
    - The prediction result is displayed to the user through the Streamlit app, along with appropriate messages indicating the likelihood of having diabetes or not.
